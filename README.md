zip file.
2. Move the .zip file to your `sei/projects/` directory and Unzip it (creating a
   folder) -- **NOTE:** if the folder was already unzipped, use the `mv` command
   line to move it to the `sei/projects/` directory.
3. Rename the directory from crypto-tap-api -> your-app-name.
4. Empty Readme.md and fill with your own content.
5. Move into the new project and `git init`.
6. Replace all instances of `'crypto-tap-api'` with your app name.
7. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
8. Ensure that you have `nodemon` installed by running `npm install -g nodemon`.
9. Ensure the API is functioning properly by running `npm run server`.
10. Once everything is working, make an initial commit.
11. Follow the steps in [express-api-deployment-guide](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/express-api-deployment-guide)

### Planning
## Planning Story

I began with the user routes. Using a express-template made that part easy. Next came the model for coins. Even though this was my second full application using express,
I wanted to make sure I had full hands-on control with the front and back-end as the last project I worked in a team of four.   Curl-scripts were part of the testing process. Everything was smooth until index/show. That took me awhile to review/fix
as I was having trouble defining and calling it properly, as well as styling the
component to actually populate visually.

## Problem Solving Strategy

- I utilized previous lessons/notes from GA.
- I also utilized my cohort by asking them questions when I couldn't solve an issue.

### Unfinished
